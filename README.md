Accordion Lists
===============

JavaScript code that resizes random number of lists with random number of items. Headers are always visible. Lists are spaced as equally as possible. Small lists are fit first and the remaining space is redistributed. Runs every time the window is resized. 

To run, open index.html in your browser and resize the window.
